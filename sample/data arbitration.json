However, 'Clays & Doughs' and 'Pottery & Modeling Clays' are completely irrelevant as they are craft/art supplies, not edible food decorations. From a preference awareness perspective, the query doesn't contain any low-tolerance preferences (size, quantity, age, gender, species, body part). The 'Christmas' theme is a flexible preference (seasonal), not a low-tolerance one, making all pickers preference-aware.",
